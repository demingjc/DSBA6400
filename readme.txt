The CreateAgent.py file is a combination from tutorials from these sites:

https://brax.gg/carla-agent-end-to-end-imitation-learning/

https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_G_traffic_manager/


I created route_1 by viewing the map and creating a figure 8 for the agent to travel by. The code also includes the attachment of the camera and the saving of still frames. I was unable to actually tell if I managed to get the agent to spawn by the end because it is so impossible for me to navigate the map when it is running. 


The other 2 files are pretty straight forward but I may need some guidance on how to merge all of this together. I didn't want to try and fail a bunch of times and have a bunch of saved outputs every go round
